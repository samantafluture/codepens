# Portfolio of Codepens

A simple page built with HTML, CSS and pure JavaScript to showcase my Codepens.

I built this portfolio while following a 10-day video course from [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/), called **#imersaodev**.

It was a great opportunity to refresh my knowledge of rogramming logic and to experiment with creative ideias and styles.
