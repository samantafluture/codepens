# Portfolio of Codepens

A simple page built with HTML, CSS and pure JavaScript to showcase my [Codepens](https://codepen.io/samantafluture).

I've built this portfolio while following a 10-day video course from [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/), called **#imersaodev**.

It was a great opportunity to refresh my knowledge of programming logic and to experiment with creative ideias and different styles.

## Features

- Toggle theme: light and dark mode
- GitHub color palette and similar CSS style

## See it live!
